This plugin enables registered users to request an email notification when an out-of-stock product comes back into stock.

== Description ==

A Waitlist plugin allows you to successfully handle promotional campaigns for a product or service before it is actually available: you can just enable a "wait list" option and offer subscribers a discount or a special promotion.

But it's not just that: it is also a key took to prevent losing perspective customers and therefore sales in case one of your store products goes out of stock and you need time to restock it.

How does it work?

A user finds a product in your shop, and specifically those shoes he loves and has been looking for a long time. But, unfortunately, he cannot buy them because his size is temporarily not available.

His purchase experience is really bad: so now, the only thing left to do is to leave the site and start looking somewhere else.

**What if we gave him the opportunity to subscribe to a waitlist?**

It's true, he cannot buy the shoes immediately, but there's a notice informing him that he can add his email address to be notified when his size is back in stock. **One or two weeks later, he receives an email that informs him that his size is finally available and he can buy it with a $5 discount.**

Thanks to **YITH WooCommerce Waitlist** and just one email – with a **conversion rate of around 10-15% according to market research** – you converted a prospect into a customer and made a sale that would have been lost otherwise.
